### Additional Utilities

The extension includes additional utilities to enhance your research experience:

#### Always On Top Manager
Due to Chrome extension security limitations, the extension cannot set windows to be "always on top" directly. However, we've included an AutoHotkey script in the `/utilities/` folder that provides this functionality.

To use the Always On Top Manager:
1. Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) on your computer
2. Run the `AlwaysOnTopManager.ahk` script from the `/utilities/` folder
3. Use the interface to select which windows should stay on top of others
4. Double-click any window in the list to toggle its always-on-top state

## Privacy

- All data is stored locally in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers
- You control when to export and share your research data
- Sessions can be deleted at any time

## Export Format

See [EXPORT_SPECIFICATION.md](EXPORT_SPECIFICATION.md) for detailed information about the export format and fields.
